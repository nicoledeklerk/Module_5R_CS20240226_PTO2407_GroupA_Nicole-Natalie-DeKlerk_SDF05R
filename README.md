# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

The CSS Magic Buttons project has been a really fun and informative experience. Below I describe the designs that I decided on and the challenges that I faced:

Btn-1:

This is the button that I am the most proud of and I decided to design it with the specific background colours of red, yellow and green as I am a fan or reggae music and wanted to incorporate this element into my button. I really enjoyed creating this simple button design that increases in lenght and decreases in height when hovered over. 

Btn-2:

I gave this button an animation feature that allows it to contantly extend in size and then decrease again after 5 seconds while continuing to change in various sizes and colours constantly. The biggest challenge that I have with this button is to stop the glitching that occurs between the various size extensions of the button. 

Btn-3: 

The final button is a fun one that beats like a heartbeat when hovered over and that has a border of purple, my favourite colour.
